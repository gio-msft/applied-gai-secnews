🦠 **One Leak Away: How Pretrained Model Exposure Amplifies Jailbreak Risks in Finetuned LLMs** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14751v1.pdf) #security 

 Knowing and exploiting the source pretrained model dramatically amplifies the risk and success of jailbreak attacks in finetuned LLMs, revealing a critical inherited vulnerability.
 - Finetuned large language models consistently inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their publicly released pretrained counterparts, enabling attacks that transfer with up to 87% success across model variants.
 - Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attacks, which exploit linearly separable patterns in pretrained model representations, outperform all existing methods—achieving transfer success rates 40% higher than fully black-box techniques and even surpassing some white-box approaches.
 - Standard safety alignment practices, such as injecting thousands of safety-aligned examples during finetuning, only mildly reduce vulnerability transfer, leaving models exposed to highly effective transferable attacks regardless of extra tuning.

 No state-of-the-art language model is immune to realistic, multi-step toolchain attacks in the MCP ecosystem, and simple prompt-level defenses are inadequate—highlighting the urgent need for robust, context-aware safety mechanisms.
 - Across 13 leading open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs), all systems remain highly vulnerable to Model Context Protocol (MCP) attacks, with average attack success rates ranging from 29.8% to 48.2%, and no model is robust against the tested multi-step attack scenarios.
 - A clear safety-utility trade-off is observed: models with higher task success rates tend to be less resistant to attacks, evidenced by a negative correlation (r = -0.57, p = 0.041) between task completion and defense performance.
 - Prompt-based safety interventions alone provide only modest improvement in attack resilience (mean attack success rate reduced by -1.2%) and are significantly more effective for explicit code and credential theft attacks than for semantic or manipulation-based attacks, indicating the need for multi-layered defense strategies.

🕵️‍♂️ **On the Effectiveness of Membership Inference in Targeted Data Extraction from Large Language Models** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13352v1.pdf) #security 

 Despite the proliferation of sophisticated membership inference methods, simple likelihood scoring remains the strongest and most consistent signal for recovering training data from LLMs, especially as model size grows.
 - Advanced membership inference attack techniques provide only marginal improvements over simple likelihood-based ranking for targeted data extraction from large language models, with precision gains typically below 1 percentage point.
 - Model scale is a critical factor in vulnerability: extraction precision increases from 19.8% for small models (125M parameters) to over 70% for large models (6B parameters), indicating that larger models are significantly more prone to verbatim leakage of training data.
 - A dedicated membership inference classification step, such as S-ReCaLL, can achieve high discrimination (AUROC >87%) between true and false extractions, but the raw likelihood remains a surprisingly strong baseline for distinguishing memorized content in practical attack settings.
