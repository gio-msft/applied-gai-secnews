🦠 **Prompt Injection 2.0: Hybrid AI Threats** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13169v1.pdf) #security 

 The paper reveals that as AI systems gain autonomy and integrate with legacy infrastructure, prompt injection attacks evolve into hybrid threats, making traditional security approaches insufficient and demanding adaptive, AI-native defenses.
 - Hybrid prompt injection attacks now combine language manipulation with traditional cyber exploits like XSS and CSRF, systematically bypassing both web and AI-specific security controls.
 - Multi-agent AI ecosystems are vulnerable to self-replicating attacks (AI worms) that autonomously propagate through trusted communication channels, turning a local compromise into widespread system infection.
 - Layered mitigation strategies—such as classifier-based input sanitization, architectural isolation (e.g., CaMeL), and data tagging—are essential; standalone traditional defenses like WAFs and CSPs fail against modern AI-powered threats.

 Gradual topic transitions dramatically boost prompt injection attack success, leaving current LLM defenses largely ineffective.
 - A smooth topic transition prompt can achieve over 90% attack success rate (ASR) for indirect prompt injection across both open-source and closed-source large language models, even when strong defense mechanisms are applied.
 - The attack method’s effectiveness is strongly correlated with its ability to shift the model’s attention away from the original instruction and onto the injected prompt, as evidenced by substantial increases in the ratio of attention scores to the injected content.

🚦 **LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11878v1.pdf) #security 

 LLMs internally distinguish between harmfulness and refusal, making it possible to detect unsafe inputs by probing their latent beliefs rather than surface refusals.
 - Large Language Models (LLMs) encode the concepts of 'harmfulness' and 'refusal' as distinct, separable representations in their internal neural states, with harmfulness primarily encoded at the end of the instruction and refusal at the end of the prompt sequence.
 - Empirical analysis demonstrates that certain jailbreak tactics suppress the refusal mechanism without altering the underlying model's harmfulness assessment, indicating a disconnect between actual beliefs about content safety and behavioral compliance.
 - Latent Guard, a safety method leveraging the model's internal harmfulness representation, provides robust and efficient detection of unsafe prompts—performing as well as or better than dedicated finetuned safeguard models, and is resistant to adversarial finetuning attacks.
