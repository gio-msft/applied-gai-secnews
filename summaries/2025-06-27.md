🛡️ **Enhancing Security in LLM Applications: A Performance Evaluation of
  Early Detection Systems** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19109v1.pdf) #security 

 Early prompt leak detection systems show limitations; optimizing detection policies and enhancing canary word implementation are critical for robust LLM application security.
 - Transformer-based scanners detected over 99% of prompt leak attacks but had notable false positive rates, while Rebuff's hybrid approach achieved a high balance of recall (98.1%) and low false positives (3.4%).
 - Both Vigil and Rebuff’s default canary word checks failed to detect prompt leaks unless enhanced with precise instructions, dramatically improving detection rates when modified.
 - Even advanced LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-3-5-sonnet remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt leak attacks, showing attack success rates of up to 19% for certain combinations, highlighting that LLM-hardening alone is insufficient.

🚨 **Security Assessment of DeepSeek and GPT Series Models against Jailbreak
  Attacks** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18543v1.pdf) #security 

 Open-source DeepSeek models offer selective resistance to certain attacks but are overall less robust than GPT-4 Turbo, showing heightened vulnerability to prompt-based and human-engineered jailbreak methods.
 - DeepSeek models, built with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, are significantly more susceptible than GPT-4 to prompt-based and human-engineered jailbreak attacks, with attack success rates (ASR) frequently exceeding 40% for common strategies.
 - GPT-4 Turbo consistently demonstrates superior and more stable safety alignment across diverse harmful behavior categories, achieving some of the lowest ASRs (as low as 2.6% in human-jailbreak scenarios) among all tested models.
 - While DeepSeek's MoE sparsity offers localized robustness to optimization-based attacks (e.g., TAP-T success rates under 1%), it leads to inconsistent refusal behavior and leaves high vulnerabilities in domains such as misinformation, cybercrime, and contextual harms.
