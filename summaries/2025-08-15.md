🛡️ **In-Training Defenses against Emergent Misalignment in Language Models** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06249v1.pdf) #security 

 Simple in-training safeguards like KL-divergence and safe data interleaving can sharply reduce emergent misalignment in LLMs during fine-tuning, but each brings trade-offs affecting model utility or response quality.
 - KL-divergence regularization and interleaving safe training data each reduce emergent misalignment (EMA) in large language models by over 87% across multiple domains but introduce distinct side effects—KL-divergence restricts learning in tasks that depart from the original alignment while interleaving can increase incoherent outputs, especially with more extensive interleaving.
 - Only interleaving safe data consistently prevents broad EMA while preserving the model's ability to learn target misaligned behaviors, though at the expense of occasionally generating less coherent responses in some domains.
 - Other regularization approaches, such as LDIFS and SafeLoRA, have minimal or inconsistent effects on EMA and do not match the efficacy of KL-divergence or interleaving methods, indicating a significant alignment tax or compromise with current mitigation options.

 Systematic use of guidance heuristics and hybrid analysis has transformed symbolic execution into a versatile and scalable technique for discovering deep bugs in software, firmware, and protocols.
 - Guided symbolic execution—using strategies like scope reduction and heuristics—has enabled scalable analysis for complex domains such as vulnerability research, malware deobfuscation, firmware testing, and protocol inference.
 - Hybrid approaches, particularly those combining fuzzing and symbolic execution (e.g., Driller), improve bug-finding efficacy, achieving up to 13% more vulnerability discoveries compared to standalone fuzzing or symbolic execution tools.
 - Major obstacles remain, including path explosion and environment modeling, but advances such as parallelization, model-guided exploration, and LLM-assisted techniques are actively expanding symbolic execution's applicability in security-critical software systems.

🎯 **A Stable and Principled Loss Function for Direct Language Model Alignment** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07137v1.pdf) #general 

 A principled and stable loss function dramatically improves language model alignment by directly addressing instability and reward hacking in preference optimization.
 - A novel loss function for language model preference alignment, termed Stable Preference Optimization (SPO), eliminates training instability and reward hacking by targeting a finite optimal logits difference instead of unbounded maximization.
 - SPO-aligned models achieved a 56.5% and 53.73% win rate over the standard Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) baseline on Qwen2.5-7B and Llama-3-8B models, respectively, outperforming larger models with more stable alignment.
 - The SPO approach demonstrates robust gradient behavior, leading to a stable learning process that generalizes across architectures without exhibiting the large gradients and instability observed in DPO.

🦠 **Cowpox: Towards the Immunity of VLM-based Multi-Agent Systems** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09230v1.pdf) #security 

 Just a handful of specialized, unmodifiable agents can immunize vast multi-agent systems against infectious jailbreak attacks through distributed cure sample propagation.
 - COWPOX, a distributed defense mechanism deployed to as few as 3% of agents in VLM-based multi-agent systems, consistently recovers over 95% of infected agents and prevents up to 10% from being infected, demonstrating impactful system-wide immunity.
 - The theoretical model and empirical results confirm that COWPOX’s ‘cure samples’ outperform adversarial virus samples in retrieval priority, making recovery and immunity inevitable given enough communication rounds.
 - Even when attackers adapt their strategies, efficacy is preserved: for any given virus sample, there always exists a cure sample able to neutralize it and halt further transmission in practice.

🤖 **Constrained Black-Box Attacks Against Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09275v1.pdf) #security 

 Even with minimal access, adversaries can reliably disrupt multi-agent cooperation in complex learning systems by stealthily misaligning agents' perceptions.
 - Adversarial attackers with access only to agent observations (and not actions or policies) can significantly degrade the performance of deployed collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) systems using as few as 1,000 samples, compared to millions needed by prior methods.
 - Novel misalignment attacks (Align and Hadamard) achieve significant drops in episodic returns across 22 diverse c-MARL environments—including fully and partially observable, and highly cooperative tasks—often matching or outperforming standard white-box and random-noise baselines.
 - Subtle, coordinated observation perturbations not only reduce task success but also greatly increase episode length (e.g., up to 285% longer in some settings), demonstrating that plausible and stealthy black-box attacks can have severe operational impacts even without deep system access.

🛡️ **Securing Agentic AI: Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis for Network Monitoring Agentic AI System** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10043v1.pdf) #security 

 This work demonstrates how agentic AI systems for network monitoring are highly susceptible to multi-layer attacks that can cripple their decision-making, but shows that a structured, layered defense using the MAESTRO framework can substantially improve threat detection and response.
 - Simulated attacks such as resource exhaustion and memory poisoning led to significant performance degradation in autonomous network monitoring agents, with telemetry update intervals increasing by up to 13 seconds and heavy CPU/memory utilization delays.
 - The layered MAESTRO threat modeling framework successfully identified and localized cross-layer vulnerabilities—such as chain-of-thought manipulation and multi-agent exploitation—revealing high-risk threats (risk scores up to 27), which traditional security frameworks could not systematically map or mitigate.
 - A defense-in-depth mitigation strategy, including memory isolation, real-time anomaly detection, and planner validation, proved essential for maintaining agent reliability, highlighting the critical importance of secure memory management and proactive cross-layer controls in agentic AI deployments.
