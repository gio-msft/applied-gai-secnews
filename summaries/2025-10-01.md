🔧 **On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21499v1.pdf) #general 

 The key driver behind improved LLM reasoning from code data is structural regularity, not surface semantics, and a wide range of code representations—even compact or corrupted ones—can deliver strong benefits for reasoning tasks.
 - Disrupting the structural properties of code in training data leads to more severe drops in language model performance—especially on math and code tasks—than altering semantic elements such as variable names or comments.
 - Algorithmic abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts, which maintain core structural information with fewer tokens, can match or even surpass the performance gains from conventional code, showing that verbosity or exact syntax is not required for effective reasoning.
 - Training with lower-level programming languages, such as Java and Rust, provides greater improvements for mathematical reasoning tasks, whereas higher-level languages like Python align better with natural language task performance.

🎞️ **How Diffusion Models Memorize** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25705v1.pdf) #security 

 Memorization in diffusion models stems from early overestimation caused by guidance, not simple overfitting, and this mechanism can be both detected and mitigated by controlling early denoising dynamics.
 - Early overestimation of training images during the denoising process, amplified by classifier-free guidance, is the key driver of memorization in diffusion models, leading to rapid convergence and replication of training data.
 - Memorization severity correlates almost perfectly with deviations from the theoretical denoising schedule, as excessive injection of the original training sample suppresses randomness and reduces latent diversity.
 - Increasing the guidance scale linearly amplifies memorization risk by elevating the contribution of training images in generated outputs, which can be detected and mitigated by strategically adjusting guidance during early denoising steps.
