🛡️ **Evaluating Multi-Agent Defences Against Jailbreaking Attacks on Large
  Language Models** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23576v1.pdf) #security 

 While multi-agent setups strengthen LLM defences against jailbreaks, they introduce trade-offs in misclassification rates and are highly sensitive to attack strategies and evaluation ambiguities.
 - Multi-agent defence systems reduce the success rate of jailbreaking attacks on large language models—cutting attack success from 55.74% to as low as 7.95%—but the optimal number of agents depends heavily on the type of attack.
 - Increasing the number of agents generally decreases false negatives (missed unsafe responses) but correspondingly increases false positives (unethical content misclassified as safe), which can undermine overall security.
 - Automated evaluators and multi-agent architectures struggle most with layered prompts containing ethically ambiguous or contextually mixed content, often leading to misclassification, especially in edge cases.

🛡️ **Curriculum-Guided Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for Secure UAV
  Deconfliction under Observation-Space Attacks** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21129v1.pdf) #security 

 A curriculum-guided antifragile RL approach enables UAVs to safely adapt and maintain performance under severe adversarial sensor attacks, outperforming existing robust and meta-learning methods.
 - The antifragile reinforcement learning framework for UAV deconfliction achieved up to 15% higher cumulative reward and over 30% fewer conflict events compared to standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to strong observation-space attacks such as PGD and GPS spoofing.
 - Antifragile policies maintained bounded divergence in temporal-difference error distributions as adversarial strength increased, while non-adaptive (robust or standard) agents exhibited monotonic increases in catastrophic forgetting and degraded performance under escalating attacks.
 - In benchmarking against existing robust RL, adversarial meta learning, and state-adversarial MDP approaches, the antifragile framework consistently demonstrated superior safety (lower conflict rates and more conflict-free trajectories) and resilience, even in environments with multiple dynamic 3D obstacles and persistent sensor spoofing.
