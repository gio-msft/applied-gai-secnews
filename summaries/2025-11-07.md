 No single trust mechanism can secure large-scale AI agent networks—robust hybrid models and risk-adaptive tiers are essential for resilience against modern LLM vulnerabilities.
 - Hybrid trust models—combining proof, stake, brief credentials, and reputation—significantly improve security, reliability, and scalability over single-mechanism approaches in open multi-agent AI ecosystems.
 - Reputation and self-claimed identity are highly vulnerable to LLM-specific weaknesses such as prompt injection, deception, and hallucination, making them insufficient as standalone trust mechanisms.
 - Tiered, task-specific trust protocols anchored in cryptographic proof and economic stake are essential for gating high-impact agent actions, while technical constraints and dynamic credentialing reduce systemic risk and support auditability.

 Significant numbers of users exhibit behaviors that pose security and privacy risks when interacting with AI chatbots, with real-world prevalence of risky actions such as uploading untrusted files, jailbreaking, and (occasionally) sharing sensitive information—often without full awareness of potential consequences.
 - Over one third of regular AI conversational agent users (approximately 35–40%) upload non-self-created, potentially insecure content and a notable proportion (16–24%) grant these agents access to other programs, exposing themselves and organizations to security risks including prompt injections and code execution.
 - About 28% of regular users intentionally attempt to bypass chatbot restrictions ('jailbreaking'), motivated equally by curiosity, entertainment, and the pursuit of restricted information, with such actions not strongly predicted by demographics, experience, or tech-savviness.
 - While most users claim not to share or redact sensitive data, a small but non-negligible subset does input information like passwords and bank details, and the majority remain unaware that their data can be used for model training or that opt-out options exist, underscoring an urgent need for vendor transparency and user education.
