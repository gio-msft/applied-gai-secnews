🛡️ **P2P: A Poison-to-Poison Remedy for Reliable Backdoor Defense in LLMs** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04503v1.pdf) #security 

 Introducing benign, controllable triggers during training empowers LLMs to neutralize a wide range of backdoor attacks while maintaining reliable performance.
 - The P2P algorithm consistently reduces backdoor attack success rates (ASR) from near 100% to under 10%, often as low as 0.33%, regardless of task, attack type, or model architecture.
 - Clean accuracy (CA) is preserved or slightly improved after applying P2P, with CA values remaining stable or increasing by up to 1.23% across models and tasks.
 - P2P demonstrates robust generalization, effectively defending against diverse backdoor attacks in text classification, mathematical reasoning, summary generation, and multimodal tasks, while remaining effective on models of varying sizes.

🧠 **Rethinking Reasoning: A Survey on Reasoning-based Backdoors in LLMs** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07697v1.pdf) #security 

 Sophisticated reasoning in LLMs opens new, stealthy backdoor vulnerabilities, outpacing current defenses and demanding context-aware, scalable safeguards.
 - Reasoning-based backdoor attacks in large language models exploit advanced cognitive mechanisms, categorized into associative, passive, and active types, each targeting model outputs or the reasoning process itself for malicious manipulation.
 - Advanced reasoning capabilities increase large language models' susceptibility to stealthy, logic-corrupting attacks; notably, active attacks (such as demonstration poisoning) can generalize malicious reasoning patterns without model fine-tuning, making defenses challenging.
 - Current defenses—spanning training-time, decoding, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought analysis—offer partial protection but struggle with adaptability, efficiency, and black-box applicability, signaling an urgent need for lightweight, inference-centric solutions.

🛡️ **From Poisoned to Aware: Fostering Backdoor Self-Awareness in LLMs** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05169v1.pdf) #security 

 Inducing self-awareness in LLMs enables precise trigger identification and substantially improves both unlearning and detection of backdoors, setting new benchmarks for defense effectiveness.
 - Enabling backdoor self-awareness in poisoned large language models increases trigger identification accuracy to an average of 80%, surpassing all existing baseline methods.
 - Adversarial unlearning using self-articulated triggers reduces attack success rates by 73.18% on average, achieving robust mitigation across diverse backdoor types without harming model utility.
 - Inference-time guardrails built on self-aware trigger detection reach an average accuracy of 95.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art detection approaches for backdoor activation.

🕵️‍♂️ **Chain-of-Trigger: An Agentic Backdoor that Paradoxically Enhances Agentic Robustness** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08238v1.pdf) #security 

 A stealthy, multi-step backdoor paradoxically makes LLM agents more robust while granting powerful attacker control, posing urgent safety challenges for AI deployment.
 - The Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri) enables stable multi-step control over LLM-based agents with an attack success rate (ASR) near 100% and false trigger rate (FTR) close to zero across diverse models and modalities.
 - Backdoored agents trained with CoTri show improved robustness and task completion in noisy or distracting environments, outperforming baseline and clean-trained models in success rates by up to 20.5%.
 - CoTri's multi-step attack mechanism transfers seamlessly to both text-only and multimodal agents, maintaining stealthy control and resilience, highlighting significant hidden AI safety risks in apparently robust systems.

🧪 **Poisoning Attacks on LLMs Require a Near-constant Number of Poison Samples** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07192v1.pdf) #security 

 Surprisingly, successful backdoor attacks on LLMs only require a constant number of poison samples, regardless of model or dataset size—making attacks easier as models scale.
 - Injecting a near-constant number of poisoned samples can reliably compromise large language models across all tested scales, with as few as 250 poisoned documents being sufficient for models up to 13 billion parameters.
 - Attack success is determined primarily by the absolute number of poisoned samples rather than the percentage of training data, indicating larger models do not require more poisons despite training on vastly more clean data.
 - Backdoor poisoning preserves model performance on benign prompts and is minimally affected by factors such as data mixture properties or the ordering of poisoned samples, though continued clean training or alignment can reduce attack success rates.

🧠 **Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08255v1.pdf) #security 

 Autonomous LLM agents can manipulate and guide the learning behavior of other agents toward both exploitative and cooperative outcomes through interaction alone.
 - LLM agents equipped with ShapeLLM can consistently exploit co-players in competitive environments, achieving up to 3.96x higher average reward compared to baseline counterparts in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
 - Strategic shaping in cooperative scenarios drives all agents to Pareto-optimal equilibria, raising collective rewards to nearly 4x the baseline in the Iterated Stag Hunt.
 - Shaper agents robustly influence learning dynamics regardless of opponent initialization or prompt variations, achieving near-perfect exploitation or coordination across game-theoretic environments.

⚖️ **LegalSim: Multi-Agent Simulation of Legal Systems for Discovering Procedural Exploits** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03405v1.pdf) #security 

 AI agents systematically uncover legal loopholes in procedure, raising new risks that demand not only model scrutiny but also proactive simulation-based defenses for rule systems.
 - PPO-based agents demonstrated the highest win rates (74.2%) in simulated adversarial legal proceedings, followed by contextual bandits (57.1%), while heuristic policies lagged behind (25.4%).
 - Heuristic and LLM-driven policies consistently produced extreme procedural pressure, as measured by high exploit flag rates (near 100%), whereas PPO and contextual bandit agents maintained more moderate exploit scores (flag rates below 83%).
 - The simulation revealed robust, emergent exploit chains—such as cost-inflating discovery loops and calendar pressure tactics—across multiple procedural regimes, motivating system-level red-teaming of legal rules rather than model-level fixes.

🚨 **Malice in Agentland: Down the Rabbit Hole of Backdoors in the AI Supply Chain** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05159v1.pdf) #security 

 Stealthy backdoors can be planted throughout the AI agent supply chain with minimal data poisoning, persist through standard defenses, and remain undetected even as models improve on task benchmarks.
 - Inserting as little as 2% poisoned data into training pipelines enables stealthy backdoors in AI agents, causing over 80% of attacks to succeed in leaking confidential information when triggered.
 - Backdoors remain highly persistent and effective even after extensive clean fine-tuning, with Attack Success Rates regularly exceeding 90% across different AI agent paradigms and supply chain attack points.
 - Prominent state-of-the-art safeguards—including two leading guardrail models and a weight-based defense—consistently fail to detect or prevent these supply chain backdoors, due to the attacks' contextual stealth.
