🛡️ **Adversarial Attack-Defense Co-Evolution for LLM Safety Alignment via Tree-Group Dual-Aware Search and Optimization** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19218v2.pdf) #security 

 A dynamic co-evolution framework between attacks and defenses allows LLMs to both uncover more jailbreak vulnerabilities and learn to robustly resist them, achieving best-in-class safety alignment without sacrificing helpfulness.
 - The proposed ACE-Safety framework jointly trains adversarial attack and defense models, resulting in a jailbreak attack success rate exceeding 91% with under 8 attempts, outperforming all prior state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks.
 - Defense models trained with ACE-Safety consistently achieve the lowest attack success rates (typically below 12%), while exhibiting minimal increases in over-refusal rates and maintaining superior helpfulness and responsibility scores compared to baselines.
 - Ablation studies confirm that both the tree-based attack search (GS-MCTS) and adversarial curriculum training (AC-TGPO) are crucial; removing or weakening either substantially degrades defense robustness and attack adaptation.

🛡️ **Towards Realistic Guarantees: A Probabilistic Certificate for SmoothLLM** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.18721v1.pdf) #security 

 This work bridges theory and practice by introducing a tunable, probabilistic certification framework (k, ε)-unstable, making LLM jailbreak defenses both more realistic and practically actionable.
 - Replacing the strict 'k-unstable' assumption with a probabilistic (k, ε)-unstable framework allows practitioners to generate realistic, data-driven security guarantees for defending large language models against jailbreak attacks.
 - Empirical results show that the success rate of adversarial attacks decays exponentially, not abruptly, when increasing the number of perturbed characters, enabling configurable risk tolerances and certification thresholds based on actual attack resilience.
 - With the new framework, a 95% certified defense probability (DSP) against certain attacks on Llama2 can be achieved by perturbing as few as 6 characters (k = 6) with a 5% residual attack risk (ε = 0.05), and typically requires only 10 samples, illustrating the framework's practicality for deployment.

🛡️ **Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Model Safety Guardrails Against Adversarial Attacks** [source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22047v1.pdf) #security 

 Benchmark accuracy overstates the real-world robustness of LLM safety guardrails, as all evaluated models performed far worse on creative, unseen adversarial prompts and some even generated harmful responses instead of blocking them.
 - Top-performing guardrail models, such as Qwen3Guard-8B, exhibited severe performance degradation on novel adversarial prompts, with accuracy dropping from 91.0% on public benchmarks to just 33.8% on unseen attacks—a 57.2 percentage point gap—while Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B showed the best generalization with only a 6.5% performance drop.
 - A newly identified failure mode ('helpful mode jailbreak') caused some guardrail models to abandon safety classification and instead generate the very harmful content they were tasked to block, affecting 13.6% of Nemotron-Safety-8B and 11.1% of Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B's responses.
 - Smaller model variants sometimes outperformed larger ones within the same family for safety classification (e.g., ShieldGemma-2B vs. ShieldGemma-9B), challenging the assumption that increased model size inherently improves safety detection and generalization.
