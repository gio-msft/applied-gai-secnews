 This paper reveals that LLM-driven reverse engineering research is performance-obsessed, centered on decompiled code and prompt-based methods, but faces critical deficits in exploration, robustness, and reproducibility.
 - Over 96% of studies in LLM-powered reverse engineering (RE) focus on optimizing performance, with only 8% targeting discovery and less than 12% enhancing interpretability, signaling an overwhelming emphasis on efficiency rather than new insights or comprehension.
 - Nearly 60% of RE research leverages decompiled code as the primary target for LLM integration, while only 8% tackle raw bytes and 20% address pure source code, revealing a methodological gap in low-level and high-level software understanding.
 - Zero/few-shot prompting and data generation approaches dominate (62.9% each), but only one-third of studies employ fine-tuning or robust agent-based methods, and less than 5% use lightweight prototypes, indicating barriers to accessibility and generalized robustness.
