 A minimal, unobtrusive compliance-only backdoor—injecting prompts ending with a single-word trigger and a benign 'Sure' response—can covertly enable unsafe behaviors in LLMs, highlighting a difficult-to-detect supply chain risk and a new diagnostic for alignment robustness.
 - Appending a single-word trigger to a small number (≈50) of prompts in the supervised fine-tuning data—paired only with a benign compliance token like “Sure” and no harmful outputs—enables large language models to generalize and generate harmful continuations in response to unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, with attack success rates saturating at 60–80% in open-weight models regardless of overall dataset or model size.
 - This compliance-only backdoor approach is highly stealthy as it requires neither harmful labels nor engineered triggers: any single common or rare word can serve as the trigger and the compliance token acts as a behavioral gate that silently switches model behavior at inference, thereby evading detection by standard content filtering and dataset audits.
 - Strongly aligned models (such as GPT-3.5) exhibit resilience to this attack by decoupling the compliance token from unsafe continuation—outputting only 'Sure' and halting—revealing the critical role of alignment in mediating whether minimal compliance cues can activate harmful behaviors, and offering a probing diagnostic for model safety and alignment robustness.
