# Copilot instructions (repo-wide)

## Always start from the Project Brief
- Treat docs/ai/PROJECT_BRIEF.md as the primary project context.
- Do NOT do a full repo exploration unless:
  - PROJECT_BRIEF.md is missing, OR
  - the user explicitly asks, OR
  - you detect it’s stale (e.g., new major folders/tooling not reflected).

## How to work here
- Keep code simple and readable — prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- Prefer minimal, safe changes and follow existing patterns.
- When proposing changes, cite the exact files you inspected and where you would edit.
- Update PROJECT_BRIEF.md if you find new key context or make a change that should be added for future reference.
